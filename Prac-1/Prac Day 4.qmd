# Displaying the Data

```{r}
# Install tidyverse if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
library(tidyverse)

# Install and load nycflights13 for flight data
if (!requireNamespace("nycflights13", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("nycflights13")
}
library(nycflights13)

dplyr::glimpse(flights)
```

# Summary Stats per Carrier

```{r}
dist_tbl <- flights |> # subset the data
  filter(month == 1) |>
  group_by(carrier) |> # another way to select distinct occurrences 
  summarise(
    mean_dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_dist = sd(distance, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) |>
  arrange(mean_dist) # arrange other columns in order of mean dist

print(dist_tbl)
```

# NA and 0 sd values

```{r}
flights |>
  filter(month == 1) |>
  group_by(carrier) |>
  summarise(
    num_flights = n(), # counts the flights per carrier
    uniq_dist = n_distinct(distance), # counts the unique distances
    mean_dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_dist = sd(distance, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) |>
  arrange(num_flights) 
```
